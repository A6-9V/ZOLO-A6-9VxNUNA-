## Branching Strategy

- `main` is the default branch. It should always be stable and deployable.
- Always create a new branch for your work.
- Use descriptive branch names: `feat/some-feature` or `fix/some-bug`.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Ensure your code follows the existing style (run `npm run lint`).
3. Ensure no high-severity security vulnerabilities are introduced (run `npm audit`).
4. Submit a Pull Request targeting the `main` branch.
5. Once approved, your PR will be merged into `main`.

## Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do NOT open a public issue. Instead, refer to [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for reporting instructions.
